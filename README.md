# comments-analysis

In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of user-generated comments on a social media platform to better understand the factors influencing comment popularity. The analysis involved investigating the linguistic features and patterns within comments posted in response to various posts. Data was presented by Russian social media platform "Vk". Here are the key findings:

1. Comment Length and Popularity:

Our first hypothesis was centered around the relationship between comment length and popularity. We discovered a substantial difference between the number of words in popular and unpopular comments.
Notably, the median word count in the most popular comments for each post was nearly double that of the least popular comments. This suggests a strong correlation between comment length and its likelihood of gaining popularity.

2. The Complexity of Punctuation:

Another crucial aspect we explored was the use of punctuation, particularly the frequency of commas, in comments.
Our third hypothesis led to a somewhat counterintuitive observation: more popular comments tend to have fewer commas relative to the total number of words in the comment.
This finding suggests that popular commenters employ fewer commas, potentially indicating a simpler and more straightforward expression of thoughts. This straightforwardness may contribute to the comments' popularity by making them more accessible and understandable to a broader audience.
